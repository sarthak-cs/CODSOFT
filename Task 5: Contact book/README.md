# Task 5 - Contact Book (CLI + GUI)

This project is part of my **CodSoft Python Internship**.  
It’s a simple **Contact Book App** built in two versions - **CLI** and **GUI** - using Python and **pickle file handling** for data storage and Tkinter for GUI.

---

## CLI Version
A command-line version that allows you to:
- Lets users add, view, search, update and delete contacts
- Displays all stored contacts in a formatted view
- Store all Contacts efficiently using the `pickle` module
- Stores name, contact number, email and address

---

## GUI Version
A graphical version of the same To-Do app built using **Tkinter**.
Features:
- Provides text boxes and buttons for all key operations
- Displays contact details dynamically
- Allows adding, searching, updating and deleting contacts
- contacts are saved persistently using `pickle`
- stores name and contact number
