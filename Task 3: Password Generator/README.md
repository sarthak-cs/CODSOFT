# Task 3: Password Generator (CLI + GUI)

This is **Task 3** of my **CodSoft Python Internship**, where I built a **Password Generator** in two versions - **CLI (Command Line)** and **GUI (Graphical User Interface)** using Python and Tkinter.

---

## Project Overview
The Password Generator helps users create strong, random passwords with a single click or command input.  
It ensures password security through randomness and character variety.

---

## CLI Version
A simple terminal-based version that:
- Takes desired password length from the user  
- Generates a random password using letters, numbers and symbols  
- Prints the generated password in the console  

**Concepts used:** `random`, `string`, loops, and user input validation.

---

## GUI Version
An interactive graphical version made with **Tkinter**, which:
- Lets the user enter the desired password length  
- Generates and displays the password instantly  
- Includes “Generate” buttons for smooth usability  
- Handles invalid input gracefully

## Concepts Practiced
- Random password generation  
- GUI development with Tkinter  
- Event-driven programming  
- Input validation and exception handling
