# Task 4 - Rock Paper Scissors Game (CLI + GUI)

This project is part of my **CodSoft Python Internship**.  
It’s a simple **Rock Paper Scissors Game** built in two versions — **CLI** and **GUI** - using Python and **Tkinter**.

---

## CLI Version
A command-line version that allows you to:

- Takes user input (Rock, Paper or Scissors)
- Randomly generates the computer’s choice
- Compares both and displays the result (Win/Lose/Draw)
- Allows continuous play until the user exits
- takes '0' as a quit button and displays end scores

## GUI Version
An interactive graphical version built with **Tkinter**, which:

- Lets the user choose Rock, Paper or Scissors through '1', '2' or '3' numbers
- Instantly displays the result of the round whether it's win/lose/draw
- Displays the score of both, player and computer
- Provides a “Submit” option to play another round
- Includes a clean and colorful user interface

## Concepts Used

- GUI design using Tkinter
- Event-driven programming
- Randomization using the random module
- Conditional logic and input handling
- Improving user experience with visual feedback
