# Task 1 – To-Do List Application (CLI + GUI)

This project is part of my **CodSoft Python Internship**.  
It’s a simple **To-Do List App** built in two versions — **CLI** and **GUI** — using Python and **pickle file handling** for data storage.

---

## CLI Version
A command-line version that allows you to:
- Add, view, and update tasks
- Store all tasks efficiently using the `pickle` module
- Learn how data can be serialized in binary format

---

## GUI Version
A graphical version of the same To-Do app built using **Tkinter**.
Features:
- Add, delete, and mark tasks done through an interactive interface
- Tasks are saved persistently using `pickle`
  
---

## Concepts Used
- File handling (`pickle`)
- Lists and loops
- Tkinter GUI
- Functions and modular code

---

**File Used:** `Todo.dat`
